# Wiggle-Cats-Emporium

This was a project that was done for IFB104 at the Queensland University of Technology.

This is a basic project that has been done using th TKinter, SQLite, URLlib, RE, and SYS, imports in python

The basics behind this project were to Scrub the internet for products, (using specific websites), then to create a HTML document that is usable as a digital invoice. 
Along with the HTMl digital invoice, it added all of the items and their prices to a basic database file. Everytime that a new invoice was printed, the database would clear and add all of the new items. 

This was a fun project as it wasnt overly complicated, but provided enough of a challenge and taught me some tricks with regular expressions.

Overall, I am proud of the work that I have accomplished here, and am willing to try to create more basic systems like this.

Development time: 1 week
Overall marks: 24/25 (didn't document my work quite well enough)
